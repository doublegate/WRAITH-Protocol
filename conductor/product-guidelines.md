# Product Guidelines

## Documentation Style
- **Tone:** The documentation prose must be highly technical, rigorous, and academic.
- **Structure:** Prioritize formal specifications, mathematical proofs, and precise technical definitions over simplified metaphors.
- **Detail:** Explanations should assume a high level of domain knowledge in cryptography and systems programming, focusing on the correctness and security properties of the protocol.
- **Verification:** Where possible, implementation details should reference their theoretical basis (e.g., specific RFCs, papers on Noise Protocol or BBR).

## Visual Identity
- **Theme:** The visual language should evoke a "Cyberpunk" or "Terminal-Inspired" aesthetic, reinforcing the protocol's focus on invisibility and security.
- **Palette:** Use high-contrast color schemes, predominantly dark mode backgrounds with neon accents (e.g., terminal green, amber, cyan).
- **Typography:** Rely heavily on monospace fonts for data display and code, ensuring a "hacker-friendly" environment.
- **Atmosphere:** The interface should feel like a professional, precision instrument—dense, responsive, and stripped of unnecessary "consumer" fluff.

## Brand Messaging
- **Core Pillars:** Security, Performance, Invisibility.
- **Voice:** Authoritative, uncompromising, and precise. Avoid marketing buzzwords; speak in measurable metrics (latency, throughput, encryption strength).
- **Mission:** To provide the most secure and performant decentralized file transfer fabric in existence.
